## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced comprehension of IP addressing, routing protocols, switching mechanisms, and VLAN configuration.
- Advanced understanding of basic network configuration. 
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols. 
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity and networking.

### Tools Used
- Packet Tracer.
- Google (for research) .
