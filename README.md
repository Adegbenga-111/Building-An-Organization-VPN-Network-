# Building-An-Organization-VPN-Network
## Objective
Design and implement a virtual VPN network infrastructure on Packet Tracer to securely connect multiple remote locations and facilitate seamless communication between them while ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data transmission, and at the same time gaining indepth understanding of basic network protocols.
### Skills Learned
- Advanced comprehension of IP addressing, routing protocols, switching mechanisms, and VLAN configuration.
- Advanced understanding of basic network configuration. 
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols. 
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity and networking.

### Tools Used
- Packet Tracer.
- Google (for research) .
## Steps
Step 1 Network Design
This network design framework offers a systematic approach to architecting, addressing, routing, and securing the organization's network, guaranteeing a resilient and adaptable infrastructure that can be expanded to meet future growth.
The network design diagram helps to give a clear idea of what the network infrastructure should look, and which the network device is connected to which device. since this project was a simulation, only few network devices were used , as shown in the image below
